                Unauthorised intruders can be a threat to any business. They can
                either steal valuable data from the company or at times they can
                even be a threat to the employees. Earlier locking the doors
                within the organisation was the only option but this also
                limited the free movement of the employees within the
                organisation. Understanding this scenario, the access control
                systems were developed. An access control system is a fully
                automated system which not only restricts the entry of
                unauthorised visitors, it also allows the free passage for the
                employees of the organisation all of this without any human
                intervention.

              Over the past three decades there have been many challenges when
              it comes to the safety & security of commercial as well as
              residential premises. These challenges have in turn helped us to
              keep improving our services to meet the current requirements &
              safety standards. Following are the types of access control
              systems that we integrate:
