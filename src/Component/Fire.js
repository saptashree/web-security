                Fire mishaps have always been on a rise, with fire accidents
                being almost correlated to the growth & development in the
                cities. With ever increasing industrial & commercial sectors,
                there are more than 13,000 fire incidents reported every year in
                India. The reason behind this ever increasing mishaps is the
                negligence of a fire alarm & detection system or the
                ineffectiveness of the existing age old systems which have been
                installed in the factories & commercial buildings since their
                inception. To cater to this problem we at Technocrats have
                innovated customer centric solutions which can be easily scaled
                & customised to suit the premises where the system is to be
                installed. With over 3 decades of experience in the field of
                fire alarm & detection systems. Technocrats have always been the
                first choice when it comes to fire alarm system integration.
